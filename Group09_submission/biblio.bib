abstract = {The rape victims are frightened to report with a fear of retaliation or humiliation. Consequently, the number of reported rapes is under-estimated. How should the number of unreported rapes be identified is discussed in this article. For this purpose, the Poisson distribution is modified and it is named Bumped-up Poisson distribution in this article. Related probability-informatics are derived to estimate the unreported rapes and proportion fearing to report. A hypothesis testing procedure is developed to assess the significance of an estimated proportion fearing. Our approach is tried with the reported rapes during the years 2007 and 2008 in a random sample of nations in all the continents. Proximities among the nations are identified in rape incidences.},
